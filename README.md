# Description
Welcome to the ClickButDont project! This project aims to raise awareness about the potential dangers of clicking on unknown or suspicious links. The internet is a vast and diverse place, filled with both valuable resources and potential threats. It's important to exercise caution and be mindful of the links you click on to protect yourself and your personal information.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to educate users about the risks associated with clicking on unfamiliar links, whether they are received via email, social media, or any other platform. By understanding the potential dangers, users can make informed decisions and take necessary precautions to maintain their online security.

How It Works
ClickButDont is a web application that simulates various scenarios involving suspicious links. Users will be presented with a series of clickable links, each corresponding to a different scenario. The scenarios may range from harmless to potentially harmful. The goal is to encourage users to think critically before clicking on a link and to be cautious about the potential consequences.

Features
Scenario Simulation: Users will be presented with a series of clickable links that simulate different scenarios. Each scenario will provide a brief description, and users can choose whether to click on the link or not.

Educational Content: The application will provide informative content about common types of online threats, such as phishing, malware, and social engineering. Users can learn about the warning signs and best practices to avoid falling victim to these threats.

Interactive Feedback: After each scenario, users will receive feedback regarding the potential consequences of their choices. This feedback will help users understand the risks associated with clicking on unknown links and reinforce the importance of cautious behavior.

User Profiles: Users can create profiles to track their progress, earn achievements, and compete with friends or other users to encourage safe browsing habits.
